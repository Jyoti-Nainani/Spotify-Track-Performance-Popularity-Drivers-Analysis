# Spotify-Track-Performance-Popularity-Drivers-Analysis
## Project Objectives
This project analyzes Spotify track data to understand how genre mix and content attributes influence track popularity. The goal is to identify engagement patterns and uncover strategic oppoetunities for catalog optimization and user growth.
## Dashboards
## Key Drivers of Track Popularity

## Dataset Overview

- Total Tracks Analyzed(for Genre): **4,197**
- Total Tracks Analyzed(for Popularity): **8,583**
- Source: Spotify Track Dataset(from Kaggle)
- Note: Analysis conducted on available records after cleaning missing genre values.
## Key Insights
### Genre Landscape

- **Soundtrack** is the most represented genre(352 tracks) by volume, but shows average popularity(37.2).
- **Reggaeton** demonstrates the highest engagement (average poularity: 71.9) despite lower catalog volume(83).
- Identified a clear **volume vs engagement gap** across genres.
### Content Attribute Analysis

- Explicit tracks have higher average popularity (**57.5 vs 50.5**)score, but the effect size is moderate.
- Track type analysis(Album vs Compilation vs Single) shows format level variation in engagement.
- Correlation analysis suggests **no single feature strongly drives popularity**, indicating multi-factor influence.
## Business Implications

- **Targeted genre expansion** (e.g., high-performing niche genres) can increase listening time and retention.
- Over- expansion of any single genre risks catalog saturation and audience fragmentation.
- A **balanced portfolio strategy** combined with personalized discovery is likely to maximize platform LTV.
- Content expilicitness alone is not a primary growth lever; broader content strategy is required.
## Strategic Implications

- The most available genre is not the most preferred genre.
- Listener engagement is not proportional to genre representation.
- There may be an opportunity to rebalance catalog composition toward higher-performing genres.
- Popularity is engagement driven, Volume just increases representation---not performance.

## Product Market Fit

- **Saturation Effect**-- Large catalog, high competition within genre, popularity diluted across many tracks.
                   -- Smaller catalog, less internal competition, higher engagement concentration.
- **Niche Audience Strength**-- Reggaeton listeners may: be highly loyal, stream repeatedly, engage more intensely per track; that raises average popularity.
- **Algorithmic Boost**-- Platform often: promote trending regional genres, push emerging markets, reward high engagement velocity. If a track trends strongly, algorithm may amplify them.
